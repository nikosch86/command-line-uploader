TestFairy Command Line Uploader
===============================

TestFairy's Command Line Uploader is a shell script to upload your IPA or APK files to TestFairy for monitoring and distribution.

There are 3 shell scripts in this repository:

* `testfairy-uploader.sh`
  Will upload iOS IPA files or Android APK files to TestFairy for distribution.

* `testfairy-upload-android-windows.bat`
  Will upload APK Files from Windlows servers.

When working with these shells scripts, notice that you will have to edit them and provide your **API KEY** and (optionally) other values such as testers groups to invite, metrics to record and other settings.
